# Amazon
In online shopping, shopping sequence data is available - buying item category A and then B, C, D, etc.
This forms a network in shopping data. Chart 2 shows an item category network in Amazon purchasing
data. Buying “video game” is followed by “Travel” book, “Home and Garden” and so on. On the right
hand side of Chart 2, “Indie Music[266023]” plays broker role in that removing this splits network into
two components. Chart 1 shows network in amazon0302 data. It shows star network with high density
at central area. The purpose of this paper is to segment such a Core Item Group. This core group is
clearly different from peripheral outlier nodes as you can see in Chart 1. The core group is also a broker
who is not single node but actually very large group so that we could think it as core group surrounded
by smaller peripheral group. Core group has strong tie within the group meaning that customers are
more likely to do co-purchasing within the group where peripheral group doesn’t. This helps you to
understand promo and sales strategy.
