In online shopping, shopping sequence data is available - buying item category A and then B, C, D, etc.
This forms a network in shopping data. For example, Buying “video game” is followed by “Travel” book, “Home and Garden” and so on.  Shopping network over all shoppers usually creates a star network with high density
at central area and some peripheral items. High density central of the network is defined as "Core Item Group" which is most frequent transaction item category. The purpose of this paper is to segment such a Core Item Group. This core group is
clearly different from peripheral outlier category item. It is also a broker whose loss result in complete broken down of peripheral items purchasing opportunity. However the core group is not single node but actually very large group so that we could think it as core group surrounded by smaller peripheral group. Core group has strong tie within the group meaning that customers are
more likely to do co-purchasing within the group where peripheral group doesn’t. This helps you to
understand what is our most important frequently moving category to help to build promo model and sales strategy.
